# C-Section-prediction-UNP-ML-Project
The objective of this project is to build machine learning models to predict whether a caesarian is required or not. The UCI Machine Learning Repository hosts a dataset called "Caesarian Section Classification Dataset", which contains information on the medical histories of 80 pregnant women who underwent cesarean section (C-section) deliveries.
